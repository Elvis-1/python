# Task
# Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird



# n = input("What is n?: ")
# n = int(n)
# if n % 2:
#     print('Weird')
# if n % 2 == 0:
#     if(n >= 2 and n <=5):
#         print("Not Weird")
#     if(n >= 6 and n <=20):
#         print("Weird")
#     if(n > 20):
#         print("Not Weird")


# Arithmetic Operators

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

a = 5
b = 2
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)

''''Levels of testing

Four main levels or categories of testing which is units, integration, system and acceptance testing.

There are different ways in which you can categorize the different test types. There are white box and black box tests. White box testing is whether tester has knowledge of the code design and functionalities. Black box tests function with no such information and the tester has no idea about the internal implementation

In unit or component testing, the program tests specific individual components by isolating them.

The components are low level which means that they are closer to the actual written code. Unit tests can be written with packages such as pi test

Integration testing, combines the unit tests and test the flow of data from one component to another. The key word here is an interface. This means that you test if the data is correctly fetched from a database within the python code, and if you have sent it to the web page

Next is SYSTEM TESTING, which tests all the software you tested against the set requirements and expectations to ensure completeness. This includes measurements of the location of deployed components such as reliability, performance, security and load balancing

The final type of testing is acceptance testing. When the product arrives at this stage, it's generally considered to be ready for deployment. It's expected to be bug free and meet the set standards. The stakeholders and the select few end users are involved in acceptance testing.
